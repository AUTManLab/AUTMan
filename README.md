Abstract
----------
Recent advances in computer vision have made the detection
of landmarks on the soccer field easier for teams. However, the detec-
tion of other robots is also a critical capability that has not garnered
much attention in the RoboCup community so far. This problem is well
represented in different RoboCup Soccer and Rescue Robot Leagues.
In this paper, we compare several two-stage detection systems based
on various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and highlight their
speed-accuracy trade off. The approach performs edge based image seg-
mentation in order to reduce the search space and then a CNN validates
the detection in the second stage. We use images of different humanoid
robots to train and test three different CNN architectures. A part of
these images were gathered by our team and will be publicly available.
Our experiments demonstrate the strong adaptability of deeper CNNs.
These models, trained on a limited set of robots, are able to successfully
distinguish an unseen kind of humanoid robot from non-robot regions.
